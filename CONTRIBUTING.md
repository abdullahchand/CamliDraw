## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Modern web browser
- Webcam for testing
- Good lighting setup

### Installation

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/camlidraw.git
   cd camlidraw
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types for all functions and variables
- Avoid `any` type - use proper typing
- Use interfaces for object shapes

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use proper dependency arrays in useEffect
- Memoize expensive calculations with useMemo/useCallback

### Code Style

- Use Prettier for formatting
- Follow ESLint rules
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### File Organization

- Place components in `src/components/`
- Place types in `src/types/`
- Place utilities in `src/utils/`
- Use descriptive file names

## Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing

- Test all gestures in different lighting conditions
- Test with different hand positions and movements
- Test performance with long drawing sessions
- Test on different browsers and devices

### Code Testing

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Test component behavior with different props
- Test error handling and edge cases

### Performance Testing

- Monitor frame rates during hand tracking
- Check memory usage during long sessions
- Test with different canvas sizes

## Pull Request Process

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow coding standards
   - Add tests if applicable
   - Update documentation

3. **Test your changes**
   - Run the development server
   - Test all affected functionality
   - Check for regressions

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**

6. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Use the PR template
   - Describe your changes clearly
   - Link related issues
   - Request reviews from maintainers

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit format:
- `feat:` for new features

- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding tests
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks
